# TODO:

## Code
- [ ] implement adaptive neighborhoods idea
- [ ] think about how to implement "smart Christofides": for each label, 2 paths:
    - the actual best path, and
    - a second path with those parameters which does not visit the second-to-last node of the best path
- [ ] determine if it's possible to salvage WSR3 graph idea
